# Layout Methods History

In the early days of the web, layout was achieved using tables. This was a cumbersome and inflexible approach, and it made it difficult to create responsive designs that could adapt to different screen sizes and devices. 

In the mid-2000s, CSS layout methods began to emerge as a more flexible and efficient way to create web layouts. These methods included floats, positioning, and inline-block, and they allowed developers to create more complex and responsive designs.

In 2009, the CSS Flexible Box Layout Module, or Flexbox, was introduced. Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method that allows you to create complex layouts with a high degree of flexibility and control. It has become the preferred method for creating responsive designs and is widely supported by modern web browsers.

In 2011, the CSS Grid Layout Module was introduced. Grid is a two-dimensional layout method that allows you to create complex grid-based layouts with a high degree of control. It provides a powerful and efficient way to create responsive designs and is supported by all modern web browsers.

Today, Flexbox and Grid are the most popular layout methods for creating responsive web designs. They provide a powerful and efficient way to create complex layouts with a high degree of flexibility and control, and they are widely supported by modern web browsers.

In this section, we'll explore the history of CSS layout methods and learn how to use Flexbox and Grid to create responsive web designs.
