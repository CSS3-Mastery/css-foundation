# Z Index Positioning in CSS

## What is Z Index?

Z Index is a CSS property that allows you to position elements in the z-axis. The z-axis is the axis that goes from the screen to the user. It is the axis that is perpendicular to the screen. The z-index property is used to specify the stack order of an element. An element with a higher z-index will be positioned in front of an element with a lower z-index.

## Syntax

```css
z-index: number;
```

## Example

```css
div {
  z-index: 1;
}
```

## Values

- **number** - The z-index value. It can be a positive or negative integer.
- **auto** - The default value. The element will be positioned according to the document flow.
- **initial** - Sets the property to its default value.
- **inherit** - Inherits the property from its parent element.
- **unset** - Resets the property to its inherited value if it inherits from its parent, or to its initial value if not.
- **revert** - Resets the property to its inherited value if it inherits from its parent, or to its initial value if not.
- **unset** - Resets the property to its inherited value if it inherits from its parent, or to its initial value if not.
- **revert** - Resets the property to its inherited value if it inherits from its parent, or to its initial value if not.
- **unset** - Resets the property to its inherited value if it inherits from its parent, or to its initial value if not.

## Browser Support

The z-index property is supported in all major browsers. It is supported in Internet Explorer 4 and later.

## Inheritance and Cascade 

The z-index property is inherited, which means that a child element will inherit the z-index value of its parent element. The z-index property is also subject to the cascade, which means that the z-index value of an element can be overridden by a more specific selector.
