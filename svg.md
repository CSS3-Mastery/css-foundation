# SVG 

SvG stands for **Scalable Vector Graphics**. It is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. The SVG specification is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) since 1999.

SVG images and their behaviors are defined in XML text files. This means that they can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. As XML files, SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor, but are more often created with drawing software.

SVG images can be printed with high quality at any resolution. They are supported in most web browsers and are used for vector type diagrams for example.

  </head>

  <body>
    <svg width="100" height="100">
      <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red" />
    </svg>
  </body>
</html>
```

```css
svg {
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}
```
