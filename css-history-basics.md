# CSS History Basics

CSS was first proposed by **HÃ¥kon Wium Lie** on October 10, 1994. At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation, a specification for a style sheet language. Lie and Bert Bos are credited with developing CSS.

## All CSS Versions and Their History 

- **CSS1** was released in 1996. It was the first version of CSS and was a simple style sheet mechanism that allowed authors and readers to attach style (e.g., fonts, colors, spacing) to HTML documents.

- **CSS2** was released in 1998. It added support for media-specific style sheets e.g., printers and aural devices, downloadable fonts, element positioning, and tables. It also introduced the concept of media types, support for aural style sheets, and bidirectional text, and new font properties such as `font-style`, `font-variant`, and `font-weight`.

- **CSS2.1** was released in 2011. It corrected errors and introduced some features that had been omitted in CSS2. It also added a few features that were not present in CSS2, such as the `:lang()` pseudo-class, which allowed authors to define language-specific styles.

- **CSS3** is the latest version of CSS.  It is divided into several separate documents called "modules". Each module adds new capabilities or extends features defined in CSS2, over preserving backward compatibility. New modules include:
