# Color in CSS 

The color property is used to set the color of the text. The color can be set by using a color name, a HEX value, an RGB value, or an HSL value.

## Color Names 

The color can be set by using a color name. The color name is a predefined name that represents a color. The color name is case-insensitive.

```css
h1 {
  color: red;
}
```

## HEX Value

The color can be set by using a HEX value. The HEX value is a 6-digit code that represents the amount of red, green, and blue in a color. The HEX value starts with a pound sign (#).

```css
h1 {
  color: #ff0000;
}
```

## RGB Value

The color can be set by using an RGB value. The RGB value is a 3-digit code that represents the amount of red, green, and blue in a color. The RGB value starts with the `rgb()` function, followed by the amount of red, green, and blue in a color.

```css
h1 {
  color: rgb(255, 0, 0);
}
```

## HSL Value

The color can be set by using an HSL value. The HSL value is a 3-digit code that represents the hue, saturation, and lightness of a color. The HSL value starts with the `hsl()` function, followed by the hue, saturation, and lightness of a color.

```css
h1 {
  color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%);
}
```
