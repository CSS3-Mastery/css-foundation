## Summary

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. It is used to style web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML. CSS can be used to control the layout of a web page, the colors, fonts, and other visual elements, and to create responsive designs that work on different devices and screen sizes.

CSS can be included in an HTML document in three different ways: inline, internal, and external. Inline CSS is used to apply styles directly to an HTML element using the `style` attribute. Internal CSS is used to apply styles to an entire HTML document using the `<style>` element in the `<head>` section. External CSS is used to apply styles to an entire website using an external CSS file linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` element.
