# Backgorund Drop-Shadow Cursor (CSS)

In this section, we will learn about the `background`, `drop-shadow`, and `cursor` properties in CSS. 

## Background

The `background` property in CSS is used to set the background of an element. It is a shorthand property that allows you to set the background color, image, and other properties in a single declaration.

Here's an example of how to use the `background` property:

```css
/* Set the background color */
background: #f0f0f0;

/* Set the background image */
background: url('image.jpg');

/* Set the background color, image, and repeat */

background: #f0f0f0 url('image.jpg') repeat;
```

## Drop-Shadow

The `drop-shadow` property in CSS is used to add a drop shadow to an element. It is a filter effect that can be applied to any element.

Here's an example of how to use the `drop-shadow` property:

```css
/* Add a drop shadow to an element */
filter: drop-shadow(4px 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5));
```

## Cursor

The `cursor` property in CSS is used to change the mouse cursor when it hovers over an element. It is used to indicate the type of cursor that will be displayed when the user hovers over the element.

Here's an example of how to use the `cursor` property:

```css
/* Change the cursor to a pointer */
cursor: pointer;

/* Change the cursor to a crosshair */
cursor: crosshair;

/* Change the cursor to a help icon */
cursor: help;
```
