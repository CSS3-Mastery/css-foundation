# Align Items Q&A

## What is the `align-items` property?

The `align-items` property is used to align the items inside a flex container vertically. It is used to align the items along the cross axis of the flex container.

## What are the possible values for the `align-items` property?

The possible values for the `align-items` property are:

- `flex-start`: The items are aligned at the start of the cross axis.
- `flex-end`: The items are aligned at the end of the cross axis.
- `center`: The items are aligned at the center of the cross axis.
- `baseline`: The items are aligned at the baseline of the cross axis.
- `stretch`: The items are stretched to fill the cross axis.
- `initial`: Sets the property to its default value.
- `inherit`: Inherits the property from its parent element.
- `unset`: Resets the property to its inherited value.
- `self-start`: The items are aligned at the start of the cross axis, but only for the selected item.
- `self-end`: The items are aligned at the end of the cross axis, but only for the selected item.
- `self-center`: The items are aligned at the center of the cross axis, but only for the selected item.
- `self-baseline`: The items are aligned at the baseline of the cross axis, but only for the selected item.
- `self-stretch`: The items are stretched to fill the cross axis, but only for the selected item.
- `self-initial`: Sets the property to its default value, but only for the selected item.
- `self-inherit`: Inherits the property from its parent element, but only for the selected item.
- `self-unset`: Resets the property to its inherited value, but only for the selected item.
- `safe`: The items are aligned at the start of the cross axis, but only for the selected item, taking into account the safe area of the device.
- `unsafe`: The items are aligned at the start of the cross axis, but only for the selected item, taking into account the unsafe area of the device.
- `legacy`: The items are aligned at the start of the cross axis, but only for the selected item, using the legacy alignment method.
- `legacy-overflow`: The items are aligned at the start of the cross axis, but only for the selected item, using the legacy alignment method, taking into account the overflow of the container.
- `legacy-safe`: The items are aligned at the start of the cross axis, but only for the selected item, using the legacy alignment method, taking into account the safe area of the device.
- `legacy-unsafe`: The items are aligned at the start of the cross axis, but only for the selected item, using the legacy alignment method, taking into account the unsafe area of the device.
- `legacy-overflow-safe`: The items are aligned at the start of the cross axis, but only for the selected item, using the legacy alignment method, taking into account the overflow of the container and the safe area of the device.
- `legacy-overflow-unsafe`: The items are aligned at the start of the cross axis, but only for the selected item, using the legacy alignment method, taking into account the overflow of the container and the unsafe area of the device.

## What is the default value of the `align-items` property?

The default value of the `align-items` property is `stretch`.

## How do you use the `align-items` property?

You can use the `align-items` property by applying it to a flex container. For example:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}
```

In this example, the items inside the `.container` will be aligned at the center of the cross axis.

No, the `align-items` property only works with flex containers. It will have no effect on block-level elements.

## Can you use the `align-items` property with inline elements?

No, the `align-items` property only works with flex containers. It will have no effect on inline elements.

## Can you use the `align-items` property with grid containers?

No, the `align-items` property only works with flex containers. It will have no effect on grid containers.

## Can you use the `align-items` property with multi-line flex containers?

Yes, the `align-items` property works with multi-line flex containers. It will align the items along the cross axis of each line.

## Can you use the `align-items` property with single-line flex containers?

Yes, the `align-items` property works with single-line flex containers. It will align the items along the cross axis of the container.

## Can you use the `align-items` property with the `align-content` property?

Yes, you can use the `align-items` property with the `align-content` property. The `align-items` property aligns the items along the cross axis of the container, while the `align-content` property aligns the lines of items along the cross axis of the container.

## Can you use the `align-items` property with the `align-self` property?

Yes, you can use the `align-items` property with the `align-self` property. The `align-items` property aligns the items along the cross axis of the container, while the `align-self` property aligns a single item along the cross axis of the container.

## Can you use the `align-items` property with the `justify-content` property?

No, the `align-items` property only works with flex containers, while the `justify-content` property only works with flex items. They are used to align items along different axes.

## Can you use the `align-items` property with the `flex-direction` property?

Yes, you can use the `align-items` property with the `flex-direction` property. The `flex-direction` property determines the main axis of the flex container, while the `align-items` property determines the cross axis alignment of the items.

## Can you use the `align-items` property with the `flex-wrap` property?

Yes, you can use the `align-items` property with the `flex-wrap` property. The `flex-wrap` property determines whether the items should wrap onto multiple lines, while the `align-items` property determines the cross axis alignment of the items.

## Can you use the `align-items` property with the `flex-flow` property?
