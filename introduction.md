## What is CSS?

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. It is used to style web pages written in HTML and XHTML, but can also be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL.

CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate `.css` file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.

## Why CSS?

CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. It is a style sheet language that is used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. It is used to style web pages written in HTML and XHTML, but can also be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL.

## How to use CSS?

CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This is referred to as the separation of structure (or: content) from presentation.

## What is the purpose of CSS?

CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate `.css` file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.

## What is the history of CSS?

CSS was first proposed by **HÃ¥kon Wium Lie** on October 10, 1994. At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation, a specification for a style sheet language. Lie and Bert Bos are credited with developing CSS.
